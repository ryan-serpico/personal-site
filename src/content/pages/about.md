## Ryan Serpico - Deputy Director of Newsroom AI and Automation

**Greetings!** I'm Ryan Serpico, Deputy Director of Newsroom AI and Automation at Hearst Newspapers, where I build tools that leverage generative AI and automation to empower journalists across newsrooms nationwide. My approach focuses on using AI responsibly to support reporters—not replace them—while maintaining the highest editorial standards.

## Background and Education

I'm a University of Florida journalism graduate (Class of 2018) and a first-generation college student from Pembroke Pines, Florida. My journey into the intersection of technology and journalism began during my studies, where professors Mindy McAdams and Norm Lewis influenced my path, and web app development classes sparked my technical curiosity.

## Career Path

Before joining Hearst, I worked for three years as a digital producer and graphics reporter at the San Antonio Express-News during the pandemic. There, I created workflow automation tools to help journalists work more efficiently and supported fellow reporters with incorporating data into their stories.

## Innovation in Journalism

At Hearst Newspapers' DevHub, I've developed several groundbreaking tools:

- **Producer-P**: An AI-powered audience optimization tool now helping several Hearst newsrooms, and a finalist for an International News Media Association Global Media Award
- **Radar**: An automation tool that monitors data feeds for newsworthy content
- **Kamala Harris News Assistant**: An award-nominated AI chat interface that allows readers to explore 29 years of San Francisco Chronicle reporting about Vice President Kamala Harris

## Philosophy and Approach

I'm passionate about creating generative AI-powered tools that assist local newsrooms in creating high-quality content while developing them in a responsible, ethical, and transparent manner. As I often say: "I care about doing this responsibly and safely, empowering our journalists, not replacing them."

## Technical Expertise

I specialize in building AI and automation tools for newsroom workflows, with experience in:
- Generative AI development and implementation
- Data journalism and visualization
- Workflow automation and process optimization
- Full-stack development for editorial applications
